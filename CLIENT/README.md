# Client application
This folder contains the client application designed for our forklift system. It communicates with the server to control the movement of the forklift.  

This application also features tests that can be used to test the various systems of the forklift, including streaming the video from the onboard camera.
It also has simple ease-of-use features like last-configuration saving, debug settings, and clean server exiting.
